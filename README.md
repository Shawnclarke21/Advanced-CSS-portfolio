# Advanced-CSS-portfolio
portfolio made using advanced CSS
# portfolio
the reasoning of this project was to create a portfolio that i can add onto and change throughout this course and to have something that at the one of the course i can use to apply for jobs and show what i have learned throughout these 6 months

## what i used
inside of this project i used css and html to style my page and to create an intreactive profile that takes users to my information and different projects that i have created

### what i did
in this project i started with an html file and have had lots of issues starting out trying to make it and how to navigate it due to writing this on my own it gave me a stronger understanding of how the layouts work and what i can and cant do then for the css i was able to learn and put into action what i worked with in css i had a lot of trouble learning to format but with more research and help from the teachers i was able to troubleshoot certain issues

### what does the page consist of
the page below will have my name and a title along with showing for minor projects along with one major one that i worked on when clicking on the tabs it should take you to the projects i have worked on but since i have not worked on any itll take you back to the top of the page when looking clicking on the the tabs at the top itll take you to the dedicated section.
